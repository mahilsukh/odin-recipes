 <h3>Steps</h3>                                                                
 <ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil, and spray with cooking spray.</li>

 <li>Place tater tots on the prepared sheet pan, and spray tots lightly with vegetable oil. </li>

  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned on the bottoms and edges, about 30 minutes. Keep warm in the oven until needed.</li>

   <li>Meanwhile, for chicken, season chicken thighs on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook chicken just until no longer pink at the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, cut chicken into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>

    <li>Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers to the skillet, and saut√© over medium-high heat until edges start to brown and onions turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add sliced green onions and lemon zest, and toss to combine.</li>

     <li>Add lemon juice, chicken broth, and any accumulated juices from the plate, and cook, stirring, until liquids reduce by about half, about 5 minutes.</li>

       <li>Add cream, and bring back to a simmer. Stir in chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chicken is heated through and cream sauce thickens to desired texture, about 5 minutes more.       </li>

         <li>Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Serve over hot tots.</li>
