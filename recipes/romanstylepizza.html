    <p><strong>Pizza</strong></p>
   <p><li>6 ounces Italian sausage</li></p> 
     <p><li>1 cup diced sweet peppers and onions</li></p>
     <p> <li>1 1/2 cups prepared pizza sauce</li></p>
      <p> <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li></p> 
        <p>  <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li></p>
          <p> <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li></p> 
            <p><li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li></p> 
    

    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        

       <p><li>For dough, mix together flour, yeast, and water with a wooden spoon until almost all flour has disappeared and a rough dough is formed.</li></p>

       

       <p> <li>Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3 minutes until a smooth, very soft and sticky dough forms. Clean off spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.</li></p>
        
         <p><li>Perform first set of rotating folds: leaving dough in the bowl, with a damp hand, reach under and grab the dough at the edge of the bowl, pull it and stretch it over the top. Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can, turning the smoothest side up. Cover the bowl, and let dough rest for 15 minutes. Repeat this stretch, fold, and rest process 2 more times</li></p>
          <p><li>Transfer dough into an oiled container with a lid, rub dough with a few drops of olive oil and cover. Refrigerate for 24 hours or until doubled in size. </li></p>

           <p><li>Transfer dough to the counter. With damp hands press and stretch dough into a square about 15 inches wide. Fold in half, and then in half again to create a rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, and turn over so the seam side is down.</li></p>
           <p> <li>Shape back into a neat ball with damp hand. Transfer dough into an oiled container, rub with a few drops of olive oil, and cover. Refrigerate for an additional 24 hours or until doubled in size.  </li> </p>
            <p> <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and let stand on the counter for 1 hour to come to room temperature. </li></p>
             <p><li>Meanwhile, prepare toppings: Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool. Add red peppers and onions to the same skillet, and cook and stir just until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes; remove and set aside.</li></p> 
              <p> <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (250 degrees C). Oil a sheet pan generously with olive oil. A sheet of parchment paper can be placed on the pan to prevent sticking</li></p>
               <p> <li>Transfer dough to the prepared sheet pan. Use oiled fingers to press dough into a rectangle that almost covers the pan. If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let it rest for a minute, and then continue stretching and pressing into place.</li></p>
                <p><li>Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over dough and brush to coat evenly. </li></p> 
                  <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza crust to a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Remove parchment from pan if used, then return crust to the pan.</li></p>
                  <p><li>Spread crust with sauce, scatter over sausage and vegetables, sprinkle with mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese, and finish with a dusting of Parmesan. </li></p> 
                 <p>  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are well browned, about 15 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack; let cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut and serve.</li></p>
